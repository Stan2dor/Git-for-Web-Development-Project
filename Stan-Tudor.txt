Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
A: Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". 
    
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
A: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
 A: Using Flexbox 
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
A: block by default: <p>, <h1>, <section> inline by default: <a>, <img>, <button> inline-block: <nav>
    
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
A: The CSS box model is the set of rules that decides how a CSS element’s sizes are computed as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content.
The Fix: box-sizing: border-box.
